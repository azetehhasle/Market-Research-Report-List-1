<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgery Instruments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Monopolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrosurgery instruments market is primarily divided into two categories: bipolar and monopolar units. Bipolar electrosurgery uses forceps-like instruments that deliver electrical energy directly between the tips, allowing for precise cutting and coagulation with minimal thermal spread. Conversely, monopolar electrosurgery involves a single active electrode that disperses electrical current through the patient's body to a grounding pad, making it suitable for various procedures. Both types are widely used in surgical settings, offering distinct advantages for different medical applications.</p></p>

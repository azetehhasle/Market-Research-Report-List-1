<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Smoke Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photoelectric</li><li>Dual Sensors</li><li>Ionization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial smoke detector market features three main types: photoelectric, ionization, and dual-sensor detectors. Photoelectric detectors utilize light beams to identify smoke particles, making them effective for slow, smoldering fires. Ionization detectors, on the other hand, use radioactive material to sense fast-flaming fires but may be less responsive to smoldering types. Dual-sensor detectors combine both technologies, providing enhanced protection by detecting a wider range of fire scenarios, thereby improving safety in commercial environments.</p></p>
